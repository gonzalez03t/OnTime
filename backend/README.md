# Backend

This is the backend for the OnTime. It is written in TypeScript, using Express, Twilio and Mikro-ORM. For more information, refer the the [Backend.md](../docs/Backend.md) file in the `docs` directory.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Configuration](https://github.com/medapt/medapt#Configuration) steps outlined at the root project readme.

## Testing

The API implementation was heavily tested using Postman prior to connecting with any frontend clients. The Postman collection _WILL_ be publicly available once completed.
